## Operaring System
 
COURSE OBJECTIVES
- structure of modern computers
- purpose, structure and functions of operating systems
- differentiate between processes and threads
- illustrate key OS aspects by example
- concurrency, deadlocks, memory management, processor and disk scheduling, parallel processing, and file system organization
- problems related to process management and synchronization
- the cause and effect related to deadlocks and to analyse them related to common circumstances in operating systems
- basics of memory management
- the use of virtual memory in modern operating systems
- the structure of the most common file-systems
